#SERVER-SECURITY

Many different talents are needed to protect a Solana validator node from external threats. This document will help new validators to begin to understand the complexities of software and hardware security.


HARDWARE SECURITY





SOFTWARE SECURITY

There are many good reasons that the Solana Foundation does not want validators to run externally produced binaries on their validator's nodes. A recent example of this was a 'special binary' that was sold to many validators for only 1 SOL. Apparently this was an attacker of the network and some nodes were then hacked. Never ever run any binary from anyone or any company on your validator node that is not open source or you can get a trojan software that will steal your secret Solana validator keys and send them over the Internet to the attacker's server. Once this happens you have lost your node permanently and any wallet balance or SOL balance on these node keys.
